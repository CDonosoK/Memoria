	abstract = {In computational science and computer graphics, there is a strong requirement to represent and visualize information in the real domain, and many visualization data structures and algorithms have been proposed to achieve this aim. Unfortunately, the dataﬂow model that is often selected to address this issue in visualization systems is not ﬂexible enough to visualize newly invented data structures and algorithms because this scheme can accept only speciﬁc data structures. To address this problem, we propose a new visualization tool, RViz, which is independent of the input information data structures. Since there is no requirement for additional efforts to manage the ﬂow networks and the interface to abstracted information is simple in RViz, any scientiﬁc information visualization algorithms are easier to implement than the dataﬂow model. In this paper, we provide case studies in which we have successfully implemented new data structures and related algorithms using RViz, including geometry synthesis, distance ﬁeld representation, and implicit surface reconstruction. Through these cases, we show how RViz helps users visualize and understand any hidden insights in input information.},

	abstract = {Robot localization is the process of determining where a mobile robot is located with respect to its environment. Localization is one of the most fundamental competencies required by an autonomous robot as the knowledge of the robot's own location is an essential precursor to making decisions about future actions. In a typical robot localization scenario, a map of the environment is available and the robot is equipped with sensors that observe the environment as well as monitor its own motion. The localization problem then becomes one of estimating the robot position and orientation within the map using information gathered from these sensors. Robot localization techniques need to be able to deal with noisy observations and generate not only an estimate of the robot location but also a measure of the uncertainty of the location estimate. This article provides an introduction to estimation of theoretic solutions to the robot localization problem. It begins by discussing the mathematical models used to describe the robot motion and observations from the sensors. Two of the most common probabilistic techniques, the extended Kalman filter and the particle filter, that can be used to combine information from sensors to compute an estimate of the robot location are then discussed in detail and illustrated by simple examples. A brief summary of the large body of literature on robot localization is presented next. Appendices that present the essential mathematical background and alternative techniques are provided. The MATLAB code of the localization algorithms is also available.},

An unknown node is first localized in an initial residence area according to the connectivity constraints. Then, the residence area is refined using the RSS rank vector. The RSS rank vector of an unknown node is formed from the ranks of the RSS values obtained from neighboring anchors. The estimated location of the unknown node is the centroid of the refined residence area. The proposed localization algorithm uses a grid scan approach to avoid the complex geometric computations. This algorithm is improved by using an adaptive strategy to determine the grid size. The performance of these methods is examined via analysis and simulation. The results obtained verify that the proposed approaches provide better localization accuracy than competing algorithms in the literature.},

This technique applies a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key issue is to reduce the number of particles and/or to make use of compact map representations. This paper presents an approximative but highly efficient approach to mapping with Rao–Blackwellized particle filters. Moreover, it provides a compact map model. A key advantage is that the individual particles can share large parts of the model of the environment. Furthermore, they are able to reuse an already computed proposal distribution. Both techniques substantially speed up the overall filtering process and reduce the memory requirements. Experimental results obtained with mobile robots in large-scale indoor environments and based on published standard datasets illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous mapping approaches using Rao–Blackwellized particle filters.},

	abstract = {Aiming to develop methods for real-time 3D scanning of building interiors, this work evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art LiDAR-based approaches for 3D simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) in indoor environments. A simulation framework using ROS and Gazebo has been implemented to compare different methods based on LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM). The featureless environments typically found in interiors of commercial and industrial buildings pose significant challenges for LiDAR-based SLAM frameworks, resulting in drift or breakdown of the processes. The results from this paper provide performance criteria for indoor SLAM applications, comparing different room topologies and levels of clutter. The modular nature of the simulation environment provides a framework for future SLAM development and benchmarking specific to indoor environments.},

Se emplea un modelo de equilibrio general, en el que se considera separadamente la inversión en capital robótico y la inversión en capital tradicional, permitiendo el estudio de los efectos de complementariedad y sustitución que se verifican en relación con el factor trabajo. En particular, el modelo trata el capital robótico como un sustituto directo del trabajo, mientras que incorpora al capital tradicional como complementario a este. Al someter a la economía a shocks en los precios de capital robótico, se puede estudiar los efectos en el consumo, el empleo, los salarios y el PIB. Los resultados indican que una caída en el precio de compra internacional de capital robótico produce un impacto negativo en el empleo como también en el producto. Los ejercicios realizados en este estudio indican que una disminución en el precio internacional de capital robótico en 1\%, en condiciones de altas tasas de sustitución entre empleo y robots, produce una caída en el empleo y los salarios de 0,05\% si el cambio es transitorio y de 0,25\% si es permanente por un aumento en las importaciones de capital robótico.Palabras clave: Automatización; empleo; tecnología; robots; productividad},

We report the first rover test of a laser Raman spectrometer developed for flight, the Mars Micro-beam Raman Spectrometer (MMRS) in the Atacama Desert (Chile). The MMRS was integrated on the Zoë rover and analyzed subsurface samples brought up by a 1 m drill and delivered by a carousel. The MMRS demonstrated robust performance over 50-km traverse on rugged terrains. From MMRS data, igneous minerals, carbonates, sulfates and carbonaceous materials were unambiguously identified. Quantified distributions of major minerals and carbonaceous materials are extracted from MMRS results, which can be used to imply the regional geological evolution, and potential bioactivities. MMRS in the field performed as well as an LRS laboratory instrument when MMRS was focused satisfactorily. The discovery of stable γ-anhydrite, in large quantity (20\% in a sample), in the Atacama soils raises an important question of its stability in the field in a natural environment that is worth further laboratory experimental investigation.

The system is based on a Velodyne LiDAR, acquiring points with 16 rays for a simplistic or low-density 3D representation of reality. With this, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (3D-SLAM) method is developed for the mapping and generation of 3D point clouds of scenarios deprived from GNSS signal. The quality of the system presented is validated through the comparison with a commercial indoor mapping system, Zeb-Revo, from the company GeoSLAM and with a terrestrial LiDAR, Faro Focus3DX330. The first is considered as a relative reference with other mobile systems and is chosen due to its use of the same principle for mapping: SLAM techniques based on Robot Operating System (ROS), while the second is taken as ground-truth for the determination of the final accuracy of the system regarding reality. Results show that the accuracy of the system is mainly determined by the accuracy of the sensor, with little increment in the error introduced by the mapping algorithm.},

We address this shortcoming and show how a recently developed reactive ASP system can be harnessed to provide appropriate reasoning capacities within a robotic system. To be more precise, we furnish a package integrating the reactive ASP solver oClingo with the popular open-source robotic middleware ROS. The resulting system, ROSoClingo, provides a generic way by which an ASP program can be used to control the behaviour of a robot and to respond to the results of the robot's actions.},

We present a system for fast online learning of occupancy grid maps requiring low computational resources. It combines a robust scan matching approach using a LIDAR system with a 3D attitude estimation system based on inertial sensing. By using a fast approximation of map gradients and a multi-resolution grid, reliable localization and mapping capabilities in a variety of challenging environments are realized. Multiple datasets showing the applicability in an embedded hand-held mapping system are provided. We show that the system is sufficiently accurate as to not require explicit loop closing techniques in the considered scenarios. The software is available as an open source package for ROS.},

For this framework, GMapping (a highly efficient Rao-Blackwellized particle filer to learn grid maps from laser range data) parameters have been optimized to improve the accuracy of the map generation and the laser scan. With the use of Robot Operating System (ROS), the open source GMapping bundle was utilized as a premise for a map era and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Out of the many different map generation techniques, the tele-operation used is interactive marker, which controls the TurtleBot 2 movements via RVIZ (3D visualization tool for ROS). Test results completed with the multipurpose robot in a counterfeit and regular environment represents the preferences of the proposed strategy. From experiments, it is found that Kinect sensor produces a more accurate map compared to non-filtered laser range finder data, which is excellent since the price of a Kinect sensor is much cheaper than a laser range finder. An expansion of experimental results was likewise done to test the performance of the portable robot frontier exploring in an obscure environment while performing SLAM alongside the proposed technique.},

The noise in fact limits the ultimate performances that can be obtained from a given device in terms of signal to noise ratio. After a brief review of the fundamental noise sources, particular attention is dedicated to some examples of specific sensors for which noise aspects are presented and discussed. Noise considerations will concern temperature, gas, displacement, weak force and photon sensors.},
